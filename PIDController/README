This is the code I used to find the proper PID values.
I used two XBee modules for wireless communication between a Processing (http://processing.org) application and the balancing robot. This enables me to change the PID values wirelessly without needing to reprogram the robot each time.

It really saved me A LOT of time, as it will take a while to find the optimal PID constants.

See the folder "Compiled versions" for double-clickable, standalone application for all major platforms: Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.
